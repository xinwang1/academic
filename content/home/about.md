# Biography

My name in simplified Chinese is 王鑫.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Technology Sydney’s Centre for Quantum Software and Information (UTS:QSI). My supervisor at UTS is Prof. Runyao Duan and my external supervisor is Prof. Andreas Winter (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona). Before coming to UTS, I obtained my B.S. in 2014 from the Wu Yuzhang Honors College and Mathematics Department at Sichuan University.

My research interests vary from quantum Shannon theory, entanglement theory to quantum computation theory. I am specifically interested in optimization problems in quantum information and computation.
