## Quantum Shannon theory 
Quantum Shannon theory is the study of the ultimate performance of communication with quantum systems. One of my primary topics is to characterize the communication capabilities of quantum channels under both finite blocklength and asymptotic regime. The asymptotic regime focuses on the ultimate limits of communication, while the finite blocklength regime focuses on a more practical scenario of optimizing the trade-off between the channel uses, communication rate, and error probability. Good examples of my results in this area are as follows:

- Semidefinite programming strong converse bounds for classical capacity  
Xin Wang, Wei Xie, and Runyao Duan  
IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 64 (1), 640-653, 2018. (Contributed talk at QIP 2017).

- Semidefinite programming converse bounds for quantum communication  
Xin Wang, Kun Fang, and Runyao Duan  
arXiv:1709.00200 (Contributed talk at QIP 2018).

- On converse bounds for classical communication over quantum channels  
Xin Wang, Kun Fang and Marco Tomamichel  
arXiv:1709.05258 (Contributed talk at QIP 2018).

## Entanglement Theory
Entanglement is a key ingredient in many quantum information processing tasks, including teleportation, superdense coding, and quantum cryptography. The concept of entanglement as a resource in quantum information theory motivates us to study how to detect, quantify, manipulate and use entanglement. Good examples of my results in this area are as follows:

- Irreversibility of Asymptotic Entanglement Manipulation Under PPT operations  
Xin Wang and Runyao Duan  
Physical Review Letters 119, 180506, 2017. (Contributed talk at QIP 2017).

- Improved Semidefinite Programming Upper Bound on Distillable Entanglement  
Xin Wang and Runyao Duan  
Physical Review A (Rapid Communication) 94, 050301, 2016.

## Zero-Error Information Theory
While the ordinary Shannon theory studies the communication with asymptotically vanishing errors, Shannon also investigated the information theory when errors are required to be strictly zero, which is known as the zero-error information theory.  In this area, the communication problem reduces to the study of the so-called confusability graph (non-commutative graph) of a classical channel (quantum channel). A good example of my research in this area is proving the separation between the quantum Lovász number and entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity:
